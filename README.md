## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to predict the survival of heart failure patients using an ensemble model for classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Heart Failure Clinical Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data).

## Steps Performed:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure quality.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing data distributions, relationships, and key insights.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and transforming features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Building**: Developing and training ensemble models for classification.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.
6. **Deployment**: Deploying the model using Streamlit for interactive predictions.
